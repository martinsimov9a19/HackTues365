# Different Perspective

Different Perspective is a couch multiplayer game developed by Martin Simov, Kiril Chinagarov, Marian Bitcov, Alex Videnov and Nikita Prodadonov during the Hack Tues 365 Hackathon. It's purpose is to make 2 players have fun together by sharing information about the environment around each player to explore and complete levels while having limited vision.

## Gameplay

The game is played by 2 people sitting next to each other. Both players can see their partner character, but not their own. They have to navigate their partner around the level, until each player finds their key. To complete the level both players have to navigate to the exit door and insert the keys they found, doing so they will be able to proceed to the next level. For better experience players have to split the screen in two parts and use something to block their partner vision to their player.
